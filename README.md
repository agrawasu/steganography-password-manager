# To run:
To run this program, please open the <code>main.py</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder and run it.

# Before running:
1. In order for the program to work, there must be a <code>PNG</code> file in the <code>raw image</code> folder
2. Have a password in mind before running

# Output:
A new <code>PNG</code> file will be created in the <code>encrypted image</code> with the same name as the <code>PNG</code> in the <code>raw image</code> with <code>-epass</code> at the end (i.e. <code>youtube.png</code> -> <code>youtube-epass.png</code>.
The code will print the decrypted password, which will just be the password you entered. If you read through the code, you will see, however, that this is retrieved by decrypting the encrypted steganography-secured password.
